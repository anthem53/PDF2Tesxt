# PDF2Text

This is for my task that read the PDF file.

I want to use translate the English sentence, but I cannot because pdf file sentence doesn't process not needed newline.

You can copy the the any sentence in PDF file, and click the remove newline button, then you can see well processed sentence.

There is also correct list for proper Noun in Paper. But I didn't make that function in GUI.
